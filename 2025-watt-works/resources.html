						Transform invisible network problems into compelling visual experiences
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Design an engaging visualization that reveals voltage stability issues
						<strong>OR</strong>
						network constraints to non-technical audiences. Your solution should make
						people care about a problem they can't see.
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Focus on <strong>ONE</strong> specific aspect (voltage fluctuations, peak
						demand, renewable integration) and make it crystal clear through interactive
						dashboards, data animations, or creative visual metaphors.
					</p>
					<details>
						<summary>Background</summary>
						<p>
							As the distribution network evolves, the rapid increase in domestic
							solar PV, electrical vehicles, heat pumps, and home batteries is
							creating new voltage stability challenges. These fluctuations are often
							invisible to the public and difficult to quantify for many stakeholders.
							Without clear visualisation, it is hard to build shared understanding,
							influence policy, or inspire collaborative action.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Starter Project Idea</summary>
						<p>
							Make a visualisation that shows the impact of voltage fluctuations. Use
							a heartbeat as a visual metaphor to demonstrate the grid’s health. When
							voltage is stable, it "breathes" steadily. When unstable, it shows
							visible "stress".

						Make demand flexibility fun and understandable through play
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Create a game or interactive experience that teaches how grid flexibility
						works. Players should understand concepts like peak shifting, load
						balancing, or flexible assets through gameplay - not lectures. Think mobile
						game mechanics, physical card games, or interactive simulations that work
						for audiences from age 10 to 60.
					</p>
					<details>
						<summary>Background</summary>
						<p>
							Flexibility is a cornerstone of a smarter, greener energy system.
							However, the concept remains abstract and inaccessible to many
							customers. As Distribution Network Operator’s (DNO’s) seek to engage
							more people in flexibility services, there’s a need to make these ideas
							tangible, fun, and easy to understand.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Starter Project Idea</summary>
						<p>
							Make a card game where players are grid operators trying to keep supply
							and demand balanced while dealing with unpredictable renewable energy
							and demand spikes like wind surges, solar dips, factory shifts and heat
							waves.
						</p>
						<p>
							Give players tools (flexibility services) to maintain grid stability,
							like battery storage, the ability to pause non-essential loads, or to
							delay/accelerate EV charging.
						</p>
						<p>Reward those that keep the grid balanced, penalize instability.</p>

							SSEN have prepared a website detailing what datasets are available, how
							to access them and how they might be useful for you during the hack.
							<br /><br />We’ve highlighted a few below, but we recommend going to the
							SSEN Watt Works page for the full breakdown.

					<h3>Near Real-time Data Access (NeRDA)</h3>
					<p>
						NeRDA provides live electricity demand and network health measurements from
						substations across high and low voltage networks (updated every 3-10
						minutes). You can use this for getting grid conditions in near real-time to
						identify flexibility opportunities, forecast constraints, and build
						applications that respond to actual network supply and demand.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are two parts. The Portal (or Dashboard) which provides a GUI over the
						API, and then the API itself. We recommend using the GUI to find areas and
						substations of interest, then taking the substation id from the URL to query
						the API as per the API guides linked below.
					</p>
					<p>Useful links:</p>

						<summary>Hack Pompey’s Technical Notes on the API</summary>
						<p>
							<strong>Request authentication</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							We recommend authenticating API requests using the "Short-Term API Key"
							by including the
							<code>{ Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY }</code> request header.
						</p>
						<p>
							The "Long-Term API Key" requires making <code>GET</code> requests with a
							<code>body</code> which is not supported by most request libraries or
							apis, including the native <code>fetch</code> api in JavaScript.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just keep in mind that the short-term api key will expire after a
							session, so it is wise to grab a new short-term api key before demoing
							your app for example.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>CORS issues</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are calling the NeRDA directly from the frontend of your app or
							website, you will likely encounter CORS errors. (<a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHiSt0oLJ0"
								>CORS explained in 100 seconds on Youtube.</a
							>)
						</p>
						<p>
							Calls to NeRDA are okay from a server however. To save you the trouble
							of setting up a server if you don't need one, we’ve created a proxy
							server to forward your requests for you so that you can avoid CORS
							errors and call NeRDA from the frontend.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s a drop in replacement, you just need to swap out the domain segment
							of the API URL as follows:<br /><br />
							<strong>Before:</strong><br />
							https://<span style="text-decoration: underline"
								>nerda-prod-apis-v2.azurewebsites.net</span
							>/api/ApiNerdaStatic?substation=74f42299-9f8e-4cb4-922c-0e3273bff4c7
							<br /><br /><strong>After:</strong><br />
							https://<span style="text-decoration: underline"
								>nerda.hackathons.dev</span
							>/api/ApiNerdaStatic?substation=74f42299-9f8e-4cb4-922c-0e3273bff4c7
