					<p class="rp-challenge__desc">
						Transform invisible network problems into compelling visual experiences
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Design an engaging visualization that reveals voltage stability issues
						<strong>OR</strong>
						network constraints to non-technical audiences. Your solution should make
						people care about a problem they can't see.
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Focus on <strong>ONE</strong> specific aspect (voltage fluctuations, peak
						demand, renewable integration) and make it crystal clear through interactive
						dashboards, data animations, or creative visual metaphors.
					</p>
					<details>
						<summary>Background</summary>
						<p>
							As the distribution network evolves, the rapid increase in domestic
							solar PV, electrical vehicles, heat pumps, and home batteries is
							creating new voltage stability challenges. These fluctuations are often
							invisible to the public and difficult to quantify for many stakeholders.
							Without clear visualisation, it is hard to build shared understanding,
							influence policy, or inspire collaborative action.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Starter Project Idea</summary>
						<p>
							Make a visualisation that shows the impact of voltage fluctuations. Use
							a heartbeat as a visual metaphor to demonstrate the grid’s health. When
							voltage is stable, it "breathes" steadily. When unstable, it shows
							visible "stress".

					<p class="rp-challenge__desc">
						Make demand flexibility fun and understandable through play
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Create a game or interactive experience that teaches how grid flexibility
						works. Players should understand concepts like peak shifting, load
						balancing, or flexible assets through gameplay - not lectures. Think mobile
						game mechanics, physical card games, or interactive simulations that work
						for audiences from age 10 to 60.
					</p>
					<details>
						<summary>Background</summary>
						<p>
							Flexibility is a cornerstone of a smarter, greener energy system.
							However, the concept remains abstract and inaccessible to many
							customers. As Distribution Network Operator’s (DNO’s) seek to engage
							more people in flexibility services, there’s a need to make these ideas
							tangible, fun, and easy to understand.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Starter Project Idea</summary>
						<p>
							Make a card game where players are grid operators trying to keep supply
							and demand balanced while dealing with unpredictable renewable energy
							and demand spikes like wind surges, solar dips, factory shifts and heat
							waves.
						</p>
						<p>
							Give players tools (flexibility services) to maintain grid stability,
							like battery storage, the ability to pause non-essential loads, or to
							delay/accelerate EV charging.
						</p>
						<p>Reward those that keep the grid balanced, penalize instability.</p>

							SSEN have prepared a website detailing what datasets are available, how
							to access them and how they might be useful for you during the hack.
							<br /><br />We’ve highlighted a few below, but we recommend going to the
							SSEN Watt Works page for the full breakdown.

					<h3>Smart Meter Data</h3>
					<p>
						Electricity consumption data from neighbourhoods (aggregated from 5+
						properties), which would enable you to analyze real household energy usage
						patterns, build forecasting models, and understand grid
						<strong>demand</strong> at the local network level.

					<h3>Embedded Capacity Register (ECR)</h3>
					<p>
						The Embedded Capacity Register shows all generation and storage assets
						(≥50kW) connected or waiting to connect to the distribution network, plus
						their flexibility services, helping you understand grid
						<strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>supply</strong>, identify network
						constraints, and spot opportunities for energy trading or new connections.

					<h3>SSEN Substation Data</h3>
					<p>
						The Substations Dataset provides the location, type, and identification of
						all SSEN substations (pole and ground-mounted) across Scotland and Southern
						England, cand be used to map the physical network infrastructure, analyze
						spatial distribution of supply points, and plan renewable energy connections
						or emergency response strategies.
