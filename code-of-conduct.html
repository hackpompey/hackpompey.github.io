        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>
            Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable
            environment and harassment-free experience for everyone
            regardless of their background.
        </p>
        <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
            gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
            ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views, sexual
            images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
            following, photography or audio/video recording against
            reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other
            events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
            attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
            of hackathon staff immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
            or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the
            event organisers.

            We expect participants to follow these rules at all our events.

            On arrival attendees are offered a choice of a pink or blue
            wristband. You can choose a blue wristband if you would prefer
            not to be photographed or recorded during the event. While we
            cannot guarantee that attendees with blue wristbands will not
            appear in any photographs or recordings, we do our best to
            avoid it. All attendees are expected to be mindful of others
            wristband choice when taking photographs or making recordings
            at the event.

        <p>
            Official photography and recordings of the event will be shared
            on social media and may feature on our website. If you have an
            issue with a photograph or recording you appear in, please talk
            to a member of Hack Pompey staff, contact us on social media,
            or email us at contact@hackpompey.co.uk.
        </p>
        <p>
            When taking photos, please remember:<br>
            Pink Wristband = Yes to Photography<br>
            Blue Wristband = No to Photography
