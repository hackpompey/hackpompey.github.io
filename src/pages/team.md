# The Hack Pompey Team

Hack Pompey began in 2014 as a social hack day at Portsmouth Universityâ€™s Innovation Space.

Initially started by Zac Colley and Peter Jones, two School of Computing undergrads. They were inspired by events like [hackbmth](https://twitter.com/hackbmth) and [Hacksoton](https://www.hacksoton.com/).

It has since become a non-profit organisation led by a team of six Portsmouth University graduates: Tom Hewett, Louis Capitanchik, Ryan Thicket, Ahsana Choudhury, Ming Wu, and Sage Ralph.
