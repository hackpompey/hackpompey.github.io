# Hack Pompey 2022 - Good Vibes

We want to see your most fun, upbeat, and positivity inspiring ideas. Hack Pompey has seen some great projects in the past from party fridges and automated Etch-a-Sketches to constellation mapping games and hackathon simulators. We just want you to make whatever you think will have a positive effect on the world, big or small. There is no limit on what you can make, just make sure it’s fun.

# Key info <a name="info"></a>

The event will take place April 2nd beginning at 9am and finishing at 5pm. There will be free breakfast and lunch. There will also be free hot and cold beverages available all day to keep everyone fuelled.

We have a great team of volunteers on hand to help bridge any gaps of knowledge and be generally helpful throughout. If you don’t know something, we probably know someone who does!

Our reception area where you can pick up your wristband will be open 8:30 - 17:30.

# Jetsam Challenge <a name="jetsam"></a>

Stuck for ideas? Here's a challenge from our sponsor Jetsam, who are interested in environmental citizen science and tracking waste around the city.

Their challenge is to make something cool using the Jetsam API. Check out the challenge on their website for everything you need to get started (chicken not included)

# Frequently asked questions <a name="faq"></a>

### Can I attend as a team?

We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they work together, so we highly encourage our attendees to bring friends along to make a team. If you don't have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity to form a team at the event.

### What should I bring?

Bring your tools and equipment. Laptops, craft supplies, pen & paper, raspberry pis. Whatever you need for making and developing!

### I can't think of a project idea

That's not a question, but also not a problem! Many of our attendees come up with ideas or join a team during the event.
While we encourage you to pick a project related to the theme, you are free to work on whatever you like.
Why not take a look at some projects from [Past Events](/events) for inspiration?
