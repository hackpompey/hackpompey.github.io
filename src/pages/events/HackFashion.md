Innovolvement and Hack Pompey join forces to bring you Fashion Hack.

The theme of this hack is fashion. Anything fashion goes.

Fashion Hack is a chance to spend a whole day working on something related to fashion surrounded by other passionate people!

Want to make your next e-textiles piece? Planning to use your old clothes/waste materials to create something new? A chance to learn more about wearable technology?
