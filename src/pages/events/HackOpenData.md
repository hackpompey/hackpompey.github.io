Hack Pompey is a social hack day open to everyone looking to learn, hack and meet new people.

Wikipedia says: "Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control."

We've been talking to the local council, and their open data platform Hampshire Hub. Let's use their data to solve problems, help the local public and create interesting projects!

e.g How do we reduce social isolation among older people (and are pubs the answer*)?
*not necessarily the view of Portsmouth City Council

You can grab this data and any other open data they find and run with it.
