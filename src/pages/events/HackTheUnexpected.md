# Frequently asked questions <a name="faq"></a>

### Can I attend as a team?

We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they work together, so we highly encourage our attendees to bring friends along to make a team. If you don't have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity to form a team at the event.

### What should I bring?

Bring your tools and equipment. Laptops, craft supplies, pen & paper, raspberry pis. Whatever you need for making and developing!

### I can't think of a project idea

That's not a question, but also not a problem! Many of our attendees come up with ideas or join a team during the event.
While we encourage you to pick a project related to the theme, you are free to work on whatever you like.
Why not take a look at some projects from [Past Events](/events) for inspiration?
