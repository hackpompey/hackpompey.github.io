# Hack The Unexpected

Unleash Your Creativity and Embrace the Unexpected at this year's Hack Pompey!

Join us for an exciting day of innovation, collaboration, and out-of-the-box thinking. At this hackathon, we challenge you to create a software and/or hardware project that will surprise and inspire everyone. Whether you're a seasoned hacker or a first-time attendee, this is the perfect opportunity to showcase your skills, learn new ones, and connect with like-minded individuals.

The theme "Hack the Unexpected" is open to interpretation, so let your imagination run wild. It could be anything from unexpected outcomes and breakthroughs to novel ideas and surprise twists! We want to see the creative solutions you come up with, the only limit is your own ingenuity.

In addition to the great learning and networking opportunities there will be free food and beverages throughout the event!

So what are you waiting for? Get ready for a wild ride of inspiration and innovation at Hack Pompey. Register now to secure your spot and get ready to embrace the unexpected!

# Synote Challenge <a name="challenge"></a>

Ever wondered how Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok know exactly what you should watch next? Or maybe they don't and you think you could do better?

Well our sponsor Synote have a challenge for YOU! They want to see YOUR novel solutions for recommending short videos.

Search and Recommender Systems are one of the key technologies of the modern age that everyone interacts with every day. They may seem complicated but getting started might be easier than you think, and WE think that YOU have what it takes! Tried and true technologies are out there for inspiration, but YOUR novel ideas and unique perspectives are what we'd love to see. Netflix wasn't built in a day, but we're confident you'll have fun and learn valuable skills in this challenge!

Our resident AI expert Dr Ralph has put together some resources and will be on hand and on Discord to help guide your journey of discovery!

## Search & Recommender System Resources

There are lots of approaches and datasets for search and recommendation, and lots of good tutorials online.
It's completely possible to write your own code and algorithms for recommending items how ever you think best!
But if you want to build on existing research lots of algorithms, models, and data are freely available online, mostly as Python libraries and tutorials.

### Tools

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) lets you run Python scripts in the cloud using a GPU for free. Lots of tutorials and libraries provide Jupyter notebooks you can open, run, and customise in Colab.

- [Surprise](https://surpriselib.com/) is a Python library for using, training, and benchmarking popular recommender system techniques. It comes with some popular datasets and supports making custom datasets.

- [Microsoft Recommenders](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders) is a great resource for best practices and has lots of example Jupyter notebooks for state-of-the-art algorithms. They have examples covering everything from data preparation to deploying models on the cloud.

- [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html) is another Python library that makes it simple to work with powerful pre-trained Deep Learning models for understanding text. You can use semantic search and paraphrase mining to make content-based and hybrid recommender systems.

- [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/recommenders) is a general Deep Learning framework, but provides some tutorials for building recommender systems. If you're new to machine learning this might be harder to follow, but is an option if you're interested in hands-on implementation of Deep Learning models.

### Datasets

- [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) is a huge dataset of user ratings and tags applied to movies. Probably the most popular dataset for research on large-scale recommender systems. If you're using a library they will probably have this dataset built-in.

- [Netflix Prize Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) is similar to MovieLens but also includes the date ratings were made, so we know what order people watch things in.

- [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new) has content information and stats about trending YouTube videos in different regions over time. There are no user ids so can't be used for collaborative recommendations but a great resource for search and content-based recommendations.

# Frequently asked questions <a name="faq"></a>

### Can I attend as a team?

We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they work together, so we highly encourage our attendees to bring friends along to make a team. If you don't have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity to form a team at the event.

### What should I bring?

Bring your tools and equipment. Laptops, craft supplies, pen & paper, raspberry pis. Whatever you need for making and developing!

### I can't think of a project idea

That's not a question, but also not a problem! Many of our attendees come up with ideas or join a team during the event.
While we encourage you to pick a project related to the theme, you are free to work on whatever you like.
Why not take a look at some projects from [Past Events](/events) for inspiration?
