                On March 29th, we opened the doors of the Future Tech Centre at
                the University of Portsmouth for <strong>Hack Pompey x Sea Change</strong>
                – a hackathon collaboration between yours truly and
                <a href="https://portsmouth-port.co.uk/about-us/sustainability/sea-change/" target="_blank">Sea Change</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our keenest hackers arrived as early as 8:15 AM<sup>*</sup>, eager to nab
                their free T-shirts and breakfast before diving into a day of
                creativity, problem-solving and collaboration.

                        <sup>*</sup>It’s worth noting that doors opened at 9 AM.
                        That said, we were most grateful for the extra hands during
                        setup!

                </small>
            </p>
            <h2 class="center">What is Sea Change?</h2>
            <p>
                The Sea Change project is an initiative focused on establishing
                a shore power system at Portsmouth International Port, enabling
                visiting ferry and cruise ships to use green electricity
                instead of running their engines on traditional fuel while
                docked. The project aims to significantly reduce harmful
                emissions, with an estimated saving of over 20,000 tonnes of
                CO2e annually from 2027, and establishes Portsmouth
                International Port as a leader in sustainable maritime
                technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the lifetime of the project, the Sea Change partners
                have gathered a great deal of data with regards to shipping and
                emissions activity around the port. At Hack Pompey, our
                participants were tasked with transforming that dataset into
                something that could inform and benefit the citizens of
                Portsmouth, leading to a happier, healthier city.
            </p>
            <h2 class="center">What did people work on?</h2>
            <p>
                Over 70 hackers with diverse backgrounds and skills tackled
                ideas and challenges from Sea Change and Hack Pompey, each team
                adding their unique and often humorous spin to the theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                After taking into account the opening talk, breakfast and lunch,
                teams had only 6 hours to take their projects from idea to
                completion – a tall order! In spite of this, we were so
                impressed with what our participants were able to achieve.
                Near the event’s end, a selection of teams presented their
                projects to the rest of the hackers during the Show & Tell.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, teams that presented were eligible for a few more
                awards alongside our People’s Choice Award, but before diving
                into the winners, we wanted to highlight a  few standout
                projects that were also presented:
            </p>

            <h3>Terror of the Seas</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Liam F, Lou H, Hugo C, Konstantinos V and Abdullah H
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                A higher-or-lower game built with an Arduino and designed to
                engage and inform younger generations of just how worrying the
                issue of air pollution could really be. The player is shown a
                value on a display representing the carbon particulates per
                million a boat <em>may</em> emit when berthed, the player then
                decides if the <em>actual</em> amount is higher or lower than
                that. Using an LED and buzzer combo to feedback right or wrong
                answers, the player learns very quickly that the amount of
                carbon particulates is <strong><em>always</em></strong> higher
                than one thinks.
            </p>

            <h3>Runtime Terr0rs</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Ethan E, Ollie G, Jack R and Theo K
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                Returning for their second Hack Pompey, the Runtime Terr0rs
                transformed the raw environmental data provided by the Sea
                Change team into an excellent human-friendly dashboard that
                aimed to make the data accessible and understandable to the
                people of Portsmouth. What the Terr0rs were able to do in the
                short amount of time available to them was particularly
                impressive. You can learn more about the project on the team’s
                <a href="https://github.com/runtime-terr0rs/hack-pompey-2025" target="_blank">

            <h3>Portal Kombat</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Robb Knight
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                Another Hack Pompey regular, Robb took all of the ship data
                provided by Sea Change and built <a href="https://portkom.rknight.me/" target="_blank">
                    Portal Kombat</a>, a “Top Trumps”-like game. The player
                is shown two boat cards with the real boat data points visible
                on the first, and a genuine photo of the boats on each. The
                player then has to select the datapoint on the first card that
                they think is higher than the datapoint on the other card which
                is hidden. If the player selects the higher datapoint, they win!
                Play continues until the “Yacht or Not?” bonus round, which
                we’ll leave to your imagination. Robb has done <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/hack-pompey-portal-kombat/" target="_blank">
                    his own write-up
                </a> which goes into further detail.
            </p>
            <img alt="Portal Kombat" title="Portal Kombat" src="/2025-sea-change/2025-4.jpeg" />

            <h3>The Lonely Dashboard</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Leon NG
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                Leon made a dashboard showcasing outputs from his predictive
                machine learning models that were trained on the Sea Change
                data. During his presentation Leon expressed how he was hoping
                to achieve even more than that but considering he was
                solo-running the hack, we think he did extraordinarily well to
                get as much done as he did. At the end of his presentation he
                ran through some of the things he learned at Hack Pompey,
                including to “dream smaller” next time, but we reckon with a
                couple of team mates he could have reached his goals, so
                perhaps the old adage of “Together Everyone Achieves More”
                is something to carry into the next hack.

            </h2>
            <p>
                At the end of the event, we recognised the hard work and
                ingenuity of our participants with several awards chosen and
                presented by Sea Change and Hack Pompey, alongside the audience
                favourite with the People’s Choice Award.

            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>

            <p>
                This clever project used a <em>“gaussian plume model”</em> to calculate
                and show how pm25, pm10, and pm1 particles diffused over the
                city of Portsmouth on a given day by combining the emissions
                and wind data provided by Sea Change.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sea Change team considered this an excellent and genuinely
                useful utilisation of the data. Well done Ahoy World! (and also,
                from programmers everywhere, kudos on the project name).

            <p>
                The Maritime Meridian project brought together multiple
                real-time data sources to project environment and traffic
                information onto a map of Portsmouth. Using the map, residents
                of Portsmouth are able to find optimal cycling or running routes
                to avoid high-pollution or congested areas. It also brought in
                shipping data so that residents could identify when ships were
                entering the harbour for their viewing pleasure. Checkout the

            <h3>HaNiPaSci</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Hadiseh R, Nikos P, Samuel B and Paige
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                For us, HaNiPaSci represented the spirit of the hackathon as a
                team formed from complete strangers that met in the morning.
                HaNiPaSci went on to do some impressive number crunching using
                machine learning to process the Sea Change datasets with the
                intent of surfacing which data points were of interest to the
                everyday person, and drawing appropriate correlations and
                findings throughout. The information was presented in a
                very-nearly-working dashboard. We know that with a smidge more
                time they would have got that dashboard working, and to us they
                had already achieved an amazing amount within the day.
                Well done HaNiPaSci!

            <h2 style="font-size: var(--fs-xlarge);">The People’s Choice Award</h2>

            <h3>PIP (Portsmouth Independent Party)</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0"><small><em>
                Kieran S, Jeet C, Dillon C, Brendan S, Nikhil T
            </em></small></p>
            <p>
                PIP, the People’s Choice, used the Sea Change data to classify
                real ships into two simple categories based on their emissions
                output that, via a web interface, traffic controllers at the
                Portsmouth International Port could use to quickly determine if
                a ship met the required low-emissions standards for berthing at
                the port. High-emission ships would be directed to Southampton
                in a brutally effective move to improve air quality in
                Portsmouth. Second order consequences were not considered.
            </p>
            <p>
                PIP lifted the locally famous People’s Choice Award Trophy this
                year, joining previous winners in the slowly growing Hack
                Pompey Hall of Fame. They led the award-winning teams to lay
                claim to some of the items on our new “rewards table”.
                The rewards available included a Lego Mars Rover, a Wacom
                One Drawing Tablet, Raspberry Pi 5, a Rave Coffee gift set
                complete with Aeropress and KeepCup, and many more!

                Hack Pompey’s objective is to inspire all ages to pursue their
                ideas through to fruition, experience the joy in collaborative
                problem-solving and to foster self-belief within the hackers
                that attend our event. We feel that Hack Pompey 2025 x Sea
                Change was able to do just that and we want to thank all of the
                hackers who joined us – you all did so well and we hope you all
                go on to do even greater things in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hack Pompey team would like to give a big thank you to the
                Sea Change team at the University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth
                International Port, B4T and other partners, and also to the UK
                Taxpayer that funded the great work Sea Change is doing. We hope
                that the projects worked on at Hack
                Pompey might beget further ideas and improvements to our city,
                and at the very least provide a celebratory “cherry-on-top” to
                the excellent work achieved by the Sea Change project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, this event wouldn’t be possible without our excellent
                team and volunteers. A huge thank you to Roxana Esmaeili,
                Waleed Sohail, Louise Johansson, Hannah Kenyon, Tom Apter,
                Florence Hutchins, Charlotte Simonsen, Sage Ralph, Jack Travis
                and Ming Wu, (and a humble pat on the back for ourselves,
                Ryan Thickett and Tom Hewett).
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: var(--fs-xlarge); font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
                Thank you all, Hack Pompey will return!
