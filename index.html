				<h2>Watt is a Hackathon?</h2>
				<p>
					Hackathons are time-bound events (8 hours in our case) where people from a
					variety of disciplines, including programmers, designers and engineers,
					collaborate to rapidly prototype solutions for challenges or on a particular
					theme or set of challenges.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Watt can I build?</h2>
				<p>
					We’re always excited to see what skills our participants will bring to the
					event. For Watt Works we have a number of challenges for you to choose from –
					how you solve those challenges is completely up to you!
				</p>
				<p>
					We know how daunting coming up with ideas can be though, so we'll make things a
					little easier by publishing some ideas before the event that you might want to
					attempt.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get a vibe of what people have made in the past, check out our write-up of
					our last event:

				<h2>Do I need a team?</h2>
				<p>
					We believe that people have the most fun and build the best things when they
					work together.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't yet have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunity
					to form a team at the event.
