            <p>
                Doors opened at 9 and we welcomed almost a <em> hundred</em> hackers
                in for coffee and croissants. We then had a short and sweet
                opening talk where <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-thickett-80474754" target="_blank">Ryan Thickett</a>
                led with the necessities, handing over to
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrmcwu/" target="_blank">Ming Wu</a>
                who encouraged us to use the day as an opportunity to stress-test <em>ourselves</em>.

                Everyone then settled in for what would be over <em>500 collective hours of making stuff!</em> ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

            <h3>Dance for Pompey</h3>
            <p>
                Hack Pompey isn‚Äôt a competition, but we do like to celebrate
                our attendees‚Äô favourite projects. We do that through the
                <em>People‚Äôs Choice Award</em> which is voted for by our hackers themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our runner-up for the People‚Äôs Choice Award this year was
                ‚ÄúDance for Pompey‚Äù, made by a team
                comprising <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kane-swartz-68b75311a/" target="_blank">Kane</a>,
                David, Charlotte, Rob, Artur and Sam.
            </p>
            <p>
                When writing software, programmers have a plethora of tools at
                their fingertips... but not many at their feet! Dance for Pompey
                fixed this gross oversight by introducing a Dancemat integration
                for Vim.
            </p>
            <p>The jury‚Äôs still out on whether the crowd was more impressed by
                the idea execution or Kane‚Äôs moves. üï∫

            <h3>Hamtracker</h3>
            <p>
                This year's winner for the People‚Äôs Choice Award,
                presented by <a href="https://rknight.me" target="_blank">Robb Knight</a> of
                <a href="https://radweb.com/careers/" target="_blank">Radweb</a>, was the one and only
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-gaskin-2b206a7" target="_blank">Nathan Gaskin</a>!
                His project was the ‚ÄúHamtracker‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
                Nathan‚Äôs entered into competition with his hamster (Teddy) to
                see who can run from Land‚Äôs End to John O‚ÄôGroates first.
            </p>
            <p>
                To work out who‚Äòs winning, he hooked up a sensor to Teddy‚Äôs
                hamster wheel to track the wheel's revolutions and work out the
                distance Teddy runs throughout the night, then overlaying that
                data with his own exercise tracking data onto a Google Maps
                route set from Land‚Äôs End to John O‚ÄôGroates.

                <strong>Do androids dream of electric ducks</strong> (Alex, Felix, Nikhil, Fin, Eleanor)

                TENS machine</a> to create a sort of mild-electrocution-driven

            <p>
                <strong>Your Move</strong> (James, Josh, Ysanne) brought our childhood dreams
                one step closer to reality by creating a virtual Yu-gi-oh!
                Dueling game on the web that‚Äôs able to recognise real cards
                that you show it. It even recognised Josh's hand-drawn fakes!

            <p>
                Hack Pompey is a FREE social
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>

            <p><strong>Anything you want!</strong></p>
            <p>
                People typically collaborate on solving problems, or work on an
                idea like a new product, service or  game.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know how daunting coming up with ideas can be though, so
                we've made things a little easier by setting a theme to help
                get your brain ticking.

            <h2 >Do I need a team?</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that people have the most fun and build the best
                things when they work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't yet have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty
                of opportunity to form a team at the event.
