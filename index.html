					On Saturday 15th November, students and professionals flooded into the
					University's Richmond Building for <strong>Watt&nbsp;Works</strong>,
					our&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;hackathon&nbsp;so&nbsp;far!

				<h2>Watt a day!</h2>
				<p>
					The Watt Works hackathon, delivered in partnership with
					<strong>Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN)</strong>, was an
					opportunity for the creative and curious to get stuck into the trove of data
					that SSEN has been sharing to the public via their
					<a target="_blank" href="https://data.ssen.co.uk/">Open Data Portal</a>, with
					the aim of transforming the data into something more tangible for the layman; an
					important step in bringing the public on board for the UK's journey to
					<strong>Net Zero</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The event was a culmination of months of collaborative preparation between Hack
					Pompey and SSEN, and we're very happy to say that the results exceeded
					expectations!
				</p>
				<p>
					We were excited to welcome plenty of fresh faces attending their very first
					hackathon, but also a healthy contingent of returning Hack Pompey veterans,
					ready to have another crack at the <strong>People's Choice Award™️</strong> and
					bringing their experience, enthusiasm and humour to set the tone for the day.
				</p>

				<h2>The Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					As the electricity network evolves, the rapid increase in domestic solar panels,
					electric vehicles, heat pumps, and home batteries is creating new voltage
					stability challenges. These fluctuations are often invisible to the public and
					difficult to quantify for many stakeholders. Without clear visualisations and
					communication, it is hard to build shared understanding, influence policy, or
					inspire collaborative action towards Net&nbsp;Zero.
				</p>
				<p>
					To tackle that problem, two challenges were set, both with the aim of utilising
					all that data that SSEN has been collecting:
				</p>
				<div id="watts-happening" class="rp-challenge gutter">
					<div class="rp-challenge__subline">Challenge 1</div>
					<div class="rp-challenge__title">Watt’s Happening?</div>
					<p class="rp-challenge__desc">
						Transform invisible network problems into compelling visual experiences
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Design an engaging visualization that reveals voltage stability issues
						<strong>OR</strong>
						network constraints to non-technical audiences. Your solution should make
						people care about a problem they can't see.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="flex-quest" class="rp-challenge gutter">
					<div class="rp-challenge__subline">Challenge 2</div>
					<div class="rp-challenge__title">Flex Quest</div>
					<p class="rp-challenge__desc">
						Make demand flexibility fun and understandable through play
					</p>
					<p class="rp-challenge__todo">
						Create a game or interactive experience that teaches how grid flexibility
						works. Players should understand concepts like peak shifting, load
						balancing, or flexible assets through gameplay - not lectures.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Participants jumped on the challenges and we had an excellent show & tell at the
					end of the day followed by the awarding of some very well deserved prizes.
				</p>

				<h2>Watt Happened at Watt Works?</h2>

				<p>
					While the official start time was 9am, a handful of hackers were welcomed into
					Richmond Building early – clearly keen for the welcome breakfast! As they
					checked-in, participants grabbed their lanyard, free Watt Works T-shirt and
					excellent yellow SSEN beanies. The latter coming in just in time for the cold
					snap that followed the weekend!
				</p>
				<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-17.jpg" alt="" />
				<p>
					Once in, participants were able to tuck into the breakfast. We pushed the boat
					out this time and provided a range of pastries from
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/farmbakerysouthsea/?hl=en"
						>Farmhouse Bakery in Southsea</a
					>, a wonderful local independent with a gorgeous array of baked goods. The
					Cinnamon Buns and Almond Croissants were <em>divine!</em> Hot drinks, fruit and
					biscuits were ready alongside to wake everybody up, ready for the day ahead.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ryan and the SSEN team kicked us off with the opening talk, setting the scene
					and providing the hackers with the all important "why" to help direct their
					focus. After the opening talk, we all headed over to the Future Tech Centre
					(FTC) for the hacking to begin!
				</p>
				<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-18.jpg" alt="" />
				<p>
					We would usually do a team-forming session when we get to the FTC, but for the
					first time ever we didn't need to! Everyone already had a team, or had formed
					one organically during breakfast. Hack Pompey’s slogan is
					<strong>Meet New People, Make Something Awesome</strong>. It was nice to see the
					first half being accomplished so early!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"Hack Pompey is a great event to meet like-minded makers. Everybody is
						willing to bounce ideas off each other and help each other learn"
						<small>— Michael Parker, Down with Scotland</small>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The morning session of a hackathon is usually spent pinning down a project idea
					as fast as possible, and in the case of hacks like Watt Works, wrapping your
					head around the resources provided. The SSEN team really shined here, walking
					the room and doing a marvelous job of helping participants get a grasp on
					electricity distribution and the copious datasets they provided. We know this
					made a huge difference to the quality of output at the end of the day, so pat on
					the back there to the SSEN team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ryan also did everyone a solid for this event by providing a React JS starter
					project ready to roll with connections to the NeRDA API and some bundled in
					charting libraries. This seemed pretty helpful for people and we’re hoping to be
					able to do the same for future events, possibly including a Python starter too.
				</p>
				<p>
					By lunch, we reckon most people had a pretty good idea of what they were going
					to make, and some had already made plenty of headway already.
				</p>

				<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-1.jpg" alt="" />

				<p>
					At Hack Pompey, we're always trying to make sure we get the basics right: the
					welcome, the timings, the venue, and most important of all: the food. It's a
					huge relief when lunch goes down well, and it certainly did at this event!
					Continuing the theme of using local and loved vendors, we were proud to provide
					a premium range of baguettes from
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_southsea_deli/?hl=en"
						>Southsea Deli</a
					>, a delicious range of plant-based Panuozzo's from
					<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stonesthrowkitchen/?hl=en"
						>Stones Throw Kitchen</a
					>, and some tasty tray-bakes from Farmhouse Bakery — a huge shout out to these
					local companies for making our event (and Portsmouth) a delicious place to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					After lunch everyone cracked on with their projects, and it's about time we
					talked about how they got on.
				</p>

				<h2>The Show & Tell</h2>

				<p>
					At 4pm we all went back over to Richmond Building for the Show & Tell. As the
					lecture theatre filled up, we could feel the nervous energy. 9 teams were
					shortlisted to present their solutions for the Watt's Happening and Flex Quest
					challenges and every single one of them did a <em>stellar</em> job.
				</p>
				<p>
					The event marked the first use of our home-made voting system for the People's
					Choice Award (the People's Voting System?). It performed much more reliably than
					our use of StrawPoll last year, despite being vibe-coded in a couple of hours
					the day before the event in true hack style.
				</p>
				<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-4.jpg" />
				<p>
					Finally, before we get on with the winners a note on the awards. We think this
					year was our best selection to date, we had Raspberry Pi Advent Calendars,
					snazzy gaming peripherals, board games (including the much sought after Stardew
					Valley), a Kitronik Arcade Max, HackyPi, a Wacom One drawing tablet, a £40 Tesco
					Giftcard (we know what the student truly needs), and plenty more! As was the
					whole event, these awards were made possible with SSEN's funding – thanks SSEN!
				</p>
				<p>Without further ado...</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The Winners</h2>

				<div class="winner-card">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-5.jpg" />
					<h3>People's Choice Award Winners</h3>
					<h4>Down With Scotland</h4>
					<p>
						The People's Choice Award, as voted for by all the participants on the day,
						was awarded to "Bring Down Scotland".
					</p>
					<p>
						Michael, Bethany, Scarlett and Anna built a dashboard and custom API pulling
						together Scottish grid data from SSEN's datasets, then created a simulation
						to see if you could take down Scotland's electrical grid using only kettles.
						Spoiler: you can!
					</p>
					<p>
						Try it yourself at
						<a href="http://downscot.michaelrbparker.com" target="_blank"
							>downscot.michaelrbparker.com</a
						>
						or check out the code on
						<a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's becoming increasingly clear that humour is the quintessential
						ingredient for winning the People's Choice Award!
					</p>

				<div class="winner-card watts-happening">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-6.jpg" />
					<h3>"Watt's Happening?" Challenge Winners</h3>
					<h4>Grid Heartbeat Monitor</h4>
					<p>
						Peter and Neerav pulled voltage data from Portsmouth substations via SSEN's
						NeRDA API and turned it into a clean, user-friendly web app.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their subtle "next-step" idea that we think sealed the deal was suggesting
						SSEN replace the static iconography on the NeRDA Portal with a small "live"
						heartbeat graphic showing each substation's status – packing plenty of
						signal into one tiny visual for an at-a-glance view of grid health. Genius
						seems obvious in retrospect!
					</p>
					<p>
						Check out their project on
						<a

				</div>

				<div class="winner-card flex-quest">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-11.jpg" />
					<h3>"Flex Quest" Challenge Winners</h3>
					<h4>Neighbourhood Nodes</h4>
					<p>
						Lalita and Ruchika (who came all the way down from London) built an
						interactive app where users pick a neighbourhood struggling with a power
						incident and work in groups to help solve it. Using Smart Meter database
						postcodes, the app lets you either team up with random people or choose your
						own group.
					</p>
					<p>
						They also created 3D plots and interactive scatterplots showing how
						different interventions affect the issues in real-time. Not bad for less
						than a day's work!
					</p>
					<p>

				<h2>Honourable Mentions</h2>

				<div class="honourable-mention">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-12.jpg" />
					<h4>Portsmouth Independent Party</h4>
					<p>
						Kieran, Jeetaditya, Dillon, Nikhil and Denis were back for another crack at
						the People's Choice Award after their previous appearance at Hack Pompey:
						Sea Change.
					</p>
					<p>
						Continuing with their (possibly unhealthy) rivalry of Portsmouth vs
						Southampton, this time they built a tool to compare live power consumption
						between the two cities on a per-person basis.
					</p>
					<p>
						They came to realise the app might actually be useful, so they developed it
						further to let you compare consumption data from any two bulk supply points,
						giving you energy efficiency comparisons across different areas. Check out
						the code on
						<a
							href="https://github.com/GoDenisGo/hackpompey-wattworks2025/"
							target="_blank"
							>GitHub</a
						>.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="honourable-mention">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-13.jpg" />
					<h4>Powa Powa</h4>
					<p>
						James and Rieona created an educational game that teaches how electricity
						grids work through a Puyo Puyo-style puzzle. Players either stabilise the
						network with upgrades and demand management, or throw chaos at it with
						storms and high demand events.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://waffle.dev/powapowa/" target="_blank">Play it right now</a>
						and see if you can keep the lights on. It’s made for desktop.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="honourable-mention">
					<img src="/2025-watt-works/images/ww-img-14.jpg" />
					<h4>Power Flex</h4>
					<p>
						Sage and Jane designed a physical card game where you balance and
						decarbonise a growing power grid without causing instability.
					</p>
					<p>
						You start with inefficient fossil fuel generators and consumers, then work
						to replace them with wind, solar, tidal, hydro and nuclear – but not all
						power sources are equally flexible or output the same power during day,
						evening and night. You'll need to diversify your generators and offer
						incentives to consumers to shift load and keep the grid stable.
					</p>
					<p>Word is SSEN might even commission a proper production run of this one!</p>
					<p>
						The team created a prototype with physical cards on the day, but since then
						they’ve gone ahead and made a playable online version. You can
						<a target="_blank" href="https://sageralph.github.io/Power-Flex/"
							>give it a go here</a
						>. It’s currently best played on a desktop machine.

				<p>
					Watt Works was an amazing day and it wouldn't have been possible without a
					committed organising team and the generous support of SSEN. The SSEN staff
					played a major part in both planning and delivery. They assisted with logistics
					throughout the day, chatted with participants, judged for the challenges, and
					provided those sweet beanies for attendees. Their involvement went above and
					beyond what we'd normally expect of an event partner.

				<h2>Words from the hackers</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"Hack Pompey was an incredible experience! As someone relatively new to
						hackathons, I was nervous at first, but the supportive atmosphere and the
						challenge itself really inspired us. Working with real SSEN data to create
						something that makes complex energy concepts accessible and fun was
						definitely very rewarding. The best part was seeing our idea come to life,
						from struggling with Android Studio crashes to finally being able to
						interact with our stability meter and actually get grid flexibility with a
						3D Scatter plot! The feedback from the judges and other participants was
						invaluable, and it's definitely motivated me to keep building innovative
						tech. Can't wait for the next one!"

				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"Hack Pompey was my first ever hackathon and it was totally worth it! The
						entire team was very welcoming and the challenges allowed you to build
						something that truly interests you. I was able to meet great new people and
						would definitely recommend this to others."
