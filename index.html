            <p>
                Hack Pompey is a free social
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>
                taking place on Saturday March 16th at the University of Portsmouth.
                We welcome people from all backgrounds and disciplines to join us,
                learn something new, and build something awesome together!
            </p>
            <h2 id="faq-build">What can I build?</h2>
            <p><strong>Anything you want!</strong></p>
            <p>
                People typically collaborate on solving problems, or work on an
                idea like a new product, service or  game.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know how daunting coming up with ideas can be though, so
                we've made things a little easier by setting a theme to help
                get your brain ticking.
            </p>
            <h2 id="faq-team">Do I need a team?</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that people have the most fun and build the best
                things when they work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't yet have a team, don't worry! There will be plenty
                of opportunity to form a team at the event.
            </p>

            <h2 id="testimonials">Here’s what previous attendees had to say about Hack Pompey</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "As someone who hadn’t been to a hackathon in a long while,
                    I felt immediately welcomed and inspired by the energy and
                    creativity of everybody involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether first-timer or experienced tinkerer: I'd absolutely
                    recommend Hack Pompey."

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "I’ve been a few years running and each time has been a great
                    experience, meeting people in many different sectors and finding
                    out all the recent advancements in their fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being able to ask someone ‘how do they do that’ and then
                    being able to have a go, has been invaluable to my
                    business’s research & development."
                </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "I had an actually great time at the last Hack Pompey I
                    went to; when I went the theme was Sustainability. There
                    was about 10 teams of devs there, and they made some
                    honestly cool stuff, ranging from a map highlighting
                    recycling spots, to a camera that can identify types of
                    plastic and how they should be recycled. It was fun getting
                    to know them and to be in such a productive room.
                    My team's project was Deathlaser, which was a browser-based
                    game about destroying blocks, which in my opinion is about
                    as sustainable as it gets."
