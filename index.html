            <p>
                Hack Pompey is a FREE social

            <p>
                We welcome people from all backgrounds and disciplines to join us,

            <p><strong>Anything that is on theme!</strong></p>
            <p>
                This year we’ll be
                focussing our attention on anything that could benefit from the
                data that the Sea Change team has been collecting over the last 18
                months — air quality, water quality, and even goods in and out
                of the port — or anything to do with sustainable improvements
                around Portsmouth's vital port and waterways.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know how daunting coming up with ideas can be though, so
                we'll make things a little easier by publishing some challenges
                before the event that you might want to attempt.

                things when they work together.
